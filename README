* Window positions should be remembered and stored in properties file

* Player names in chat should be in bold

* In the battle room and also chat, all pasted links should be clickable and open up in the default system browser

* Add listener to handle pressing of up/down keys in the battle list, so that the user can select battles with the keyboard.
