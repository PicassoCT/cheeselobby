Battle room list team, ally, cpu columns are not wide enough
name column is too wide

battle list keeps re-sorting itself when it updates, and when it does this it will switch between ascending and descending sort. also it does not remember what column we said we want to sort after. also it removes the highlighted game so that it's hard to select the game you want.

battle list map previews take a long time to load, they should be cached as png images instead so we don't have to load the map archive every time we select a new game

when the player's own name is said in chat, it should be highlighted in bold

game autostart doesn't work

3d map preview is broken

windows should be maximized and placed out in a good way

player names in chat should be in bold

in the battle room, the chat window should automatically scroll down when there's a new msg

in the battle room and also chat, all pasted links should be clickable and open up in the default system browser

in the chat, the user list has column names but not all are readable(they are shortened to ...) consider removing them or making the mvisible.
